# Issue

When attempting to log in, after a while, several toasts for 429 errors appear.
Inspecting the cookies, there is no wz-token cookie
The response headers for login set cookies in secure mode but the page is http
The user has a nginx server.

## Remediation

It seems like Kibana is configured to use `https` but the `nginx` instance is presenting an `http` page. The user should set their nginx to serve `https` pages instead.
