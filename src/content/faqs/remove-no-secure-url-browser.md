## Issue

If you are using self-signed certificates to expose a web, you could get in your browser the URL is untrusted.

Validate the internal user password.

For example, to force passwords to be more secure.

## Remediation

Add the CA self-signed certificate used by the exposed web to the browser. The addition of the certificate depends on your browser.
