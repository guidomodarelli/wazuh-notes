# Issue

Define mechanims to logs retention.

## Remediation

Elasticsearch

TODO

Wazuh manager - alerts

As Wazuh is not using a retention policy by default, you may set up a cron job policy to accomplish so.

### For instance

In order to delete Wazuh alerts old logs, you can use the following one:

```sh
45 0 * * * find /var/ossec/logs/alerts/ -name "*.gz" -type f -mtime +90 -exec rm -f {} \;
```
