# Issue

The alerts data is not visible in Kibana or Wazuh dashboards or stopped to be displayed.

## Remediation

This could be caused by the next reasons:
- the data is not indexed due a problem in the workflow of generation and indexation
- the filters used in Kibana/Wazuh dashboards don't match with any documents

How to review the generation and indexation flow of Wazuh alerts

1. Check the Wazuh manager/s service is running
```
systemctl status wazuh-manager
```

or

```
service wazuh-manager-master
```

2. Ensure the Wazuh manager/s is generating new alerts. Review the `alerts.json` file where the alerts are stored.
```
tail -n1 /var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.json
```

The previous command, should display the last line of the `alerts.json` file. Review if the `timestamp` property displays a recent date.

3. Ensure the `wazuh` module is installed
```
ls /usr/share/filebeat/module/wazuh
```

4. Check the Filebeat service is running
```
systemctl status filebeat
```

or

```
service filebeat status
```

5. Verify the connection Filebeat-Elasticsearch
```
filebeat test output
```

6. Review the Filebeat logs ( you could filter by errors/warnings ):
```
grep -iE "err|warn" /var/log/filebeat/filebeat
```

7. Optionally, you could review the Elasticsearch/Wazuh indexer logs too, but the problem could be identified in the above check.

- Elasticsearch
```
grep -iE "err|warn" /var/log/elasticsearch/<CLUSTER_NAME>.log
```
- Wazuh indexer
```
grep -iE "err|warn" /var/log/wazuh-indexer/<CLUSTER_NAME>.log
```

where:
- `<CLUSTER_NAME>` is the name of your Elasticsearch/Wazuh indexer cluster.

8. Ensure the Kibana/Wazuh dashboard instance is connected to the same Elasticsearch/Wazuh indexer cluster where the data is being indexed.

Problem could be caused by the filtering of data

The Wazuh plugin filters
- alerts: by `cluster.name` or `manager.name`
- monitoring: TODO

Did you changed the name of your cluster recently? This change could causes that you don't see previous alerts.
