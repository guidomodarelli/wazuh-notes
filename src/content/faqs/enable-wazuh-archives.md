### Issue

Enable `archives` of `wazuh` module.

### Remediation

The alerts generated by Wazuh is a subset of logs that match the Wazuh rules. If you want log all the data:

1. Enable the logging of all logs in the Wazuh manager.
There is 2 files:
- `archives.log`: store all logs. In the Wazuh manager set:
```xml
<logall>yes</logall>
```

- `archives.json`: store all logs as json. If you want to index this data to Elasticsearch/Wazuh indexer, enable the setting to store logs to this file.
```xml
<logall_json>yes</logall_json>
```

> Take in account that enable the logging to these files take much space. It is recommended that is disabled if it is not required.

2. Enable the indexation of `archives` logs to Elasticsearch/Wazuh indexer.

> The `wazuh` module for Filebeat has the `archives` fileset with the configuration to read the `archives.json` and index the data. It is required that the logging to this file is enabled.

2.1. Edit the Filebeat configuration `filebeat.yml` located in `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`. Enable the module changing the `archives` `enabled` property to `true`.

```yml
filebeat.modules:
  - module: wazuh
    alerts:
      enabled: true
    archives:
      enabled: true
```

2.2. Restart Filebeat service. Depending on the process manager:

```sh
systemctl restart filebeat
# or
service restart filebeat
```
