# Issue

Define mechanims to rotate the logs.

## Remediation


For these devices that do not support the installation of a Wazuh agent, you can use:

Collect the logs generated by the devices:
* Configure the remote syslog feature of the Wazuh server and send the device logs to the Wazuh server: https://documentation.wazuh.com/4.8/user-manual/capabilities/log-data-collection/syslog.html
* Configure as a remote syslog a machine with a Wazuh agent, then configure the Wazuh agent to collect the logs coming from those devices through the `localfile` option

> https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/capabilities/log-data-collection/monitoring-log-files.html#monitoring-log-files-using-wildcard-patterns

Check the integrity of the files on the device or run commands to see if they change, you can use the agentless monitoring feature: https://documentation.wazuh.com/4.8/user-manual/capabilities/agentless-monitoring/index.html
