# Issue

talk to server... ERROR Connection marked as failed because the onConnect callback failed: Filebeat requires the default distribution of Elasticsearch. Please update to the default distribution of Elasticsearch for full access to all free features, or switch to the OSS distribution of Filebeat.

## Remediation

You possibly installed the OSS Elasticsearch distribution and the default Filebeat distribution (non-OSS). Ths distribution of Filebeat and Elasticsearch should match (OSS or non-OSS).

Replace the Filebeat distribution to OSS.
